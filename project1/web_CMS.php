                	Web CMS' offer features such as, "content editing, versioning (revisions of your content), media management, workflow management for content approvals and publishing, template modification, and an easy to use dashboard of sorts to provide you with an overview of your site."

                	<h2 id="cms-q2">What are several reasons people/organizations would want to use a WCMS over a static website?
</h2>
                </header>
                <p>One main reason is the ease of training new individuals on how to maintain content on the website. Most Web CMS' use a WYSIWYG editor to some degree to allow for content editors to customize content as much as they need to without running a risk of breaking templated code. In that regard, content editors do not necessarily need to know html and there can be as many users as are necessary (<a href="moveableonline.com/blog/2013/10/29/7-advantages-using-cms-run-site/">Moveable Online</a>).</p>
                <p> An additional reason would be that come time for a redesign, the content can easily be separated from the design and reused with a new design with relatively minimal effort. Site maintenance is similar in that only one change can affect site templates whereas without a Web CMS, changes would need to be made on all pages that use that particular template. </p>

                <h3>&#183; Wordpress &#183;</h3>
                <p> Wordpress is especially ideal for hosting blogs as its scripts are catered towards those primarily. However, also with an abundance of plugins available, wordpress can compete with other major Web CMS systems. The Wordpress community is very large with active users and busy discussion boards. In that regard, Wordpress has hundreds of user-created custom templates available.</p>
                <h3>&#183; Drupal &#183;</h3>
				<p>One of the main advantages to using Drupal are that Drupal is completely customizable in terms of it's "features, operation, layout, and design [providing] loads of choice to developers and designers for addressing clients' requirements" (<a href="https://www.devsaran.com/blog/7-benefits-drupal-web-development-you-can-not-ignore">Devsaran</a>). Drupal is open source, allowing for custom modules and plugins, and has extensive API support as well.</p>
                <h3>&#183; Joomla &#183;</h3>
                <p> Joomla's advantages include it being easy to install, abundance of plugins, and an advanced navigation management system that can successfully manage several hierarchies (<a href="whichcmstochoose.com/joomla.html">Which CMS to Choose</a>). Joomla URLs are also automatically shaped to optimize for SEO purposes, creating efficiencies there.</p>
                <h3>&#183; Concrete5 &#183;</h3>
                <p>Advantages to Concrete5 would include it also being open source, but with a very intuitive drag-and-drop feature that allows content blocks to be placed directly into the  templates, giving it an easy learning curve for those newer with website management. Concrete5 also offers SEO optimization tools to help maintain optimal accountability with search engines.</p>
